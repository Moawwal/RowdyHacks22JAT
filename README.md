Languages Used: HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap all this was done on VSCODE but also tested on online ide's like replit.

Original IDEA: To create a audio to text transcript software using a Web Speech API from AssemblyAI with the support of Python(PyCharm and Jupyter)

Reformed IDEA: Create a software using web kit speech recognition API and SpeechSynthesisUtterance API's that can outmatch Alexa of Amazon or SIRI of Apple as the inspiration but of course with limited functionalites of course.

How To Run Our Program:
A Live Server should be installed prior to running the code
Once the code is opened on VSCode, go to the index.html file this is were the website will be launched of
Double click on the page then click "Open with Live Server"

## Inspiration
An AI software that could match the likes of Alexa and Siri and help in some basic aspects of day
## What it does
An AI software that is able to translate speech to text and also read out the text it out
## How we built it
Firstly we did researh into APIs and what it constitutes, then we headed over to our friends at Youtube to see projects that were similar to ours. We got some help from that, we also made sure to ask for help from mentors when we got stuck.
## Challenges we ran into
Trying to implement ASSEMBLYAI, it was the first thing we were drawn to in this project and became a segway into what we actually end up with
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finding the code for the background, and getting API set 
## What we learned
Learned how to use APIs, nobody in the group had any prior experience with APIs but we able to implement 2 APIs
## What's next for RowdyHacks_JTA44
We would like to further this project and trying out technologies related to it, we might also make JTA a travel hackaton group
